# Image-Colourization-using-dl-and-python
This deep learning project uses CNNs to colorize black-and-white images by predicting A and B channels in LAB color space. It leverages TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, and Matplotlib for applications like photo restoration, film enhancement, and medical imaging.
Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to colorize black-and-white images. The model is trained on color image datasets and predicts the A and B channels in LAB color space while using the grayscale image as luminance (L). The implementation is done using TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.

Features

Converts grayscale images into realistic color images

Uses CNNs to learn color mapping from large datasets

Implements LAB color space for better accuracy

Works with TensorFlow/PyTorch and OpenCV

Supports old photo restoration, film enhancement, and medical imaging

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-colorization.git
cd image-colorization

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Prepare Dataset: Ensure you have a dataset of color images for training.

Train the Model:

python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32

Colorize an Image:

python colorize.py --input grayscale_image.jpg --output colorized_image.jpg

Dataset

The model can be trained on datasets like ImageNet, Places365, or other custom datasets of color images.

Model Architecture

Uses a CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture

Extracts image features and learns color distributions

Outputs A and B color channels which are merged with L channel

Challenges

Generating realistic and accurate colors

Handling ambiguous regions with multiple possible color choices

Applications

Restoring black-and-white historical photos

Enhancing old films and videos

Medical imaging visualization
